# WhiteBear Inn selling system

Welcome in WhiteBear that is a small inn somewhere in Poland. We buy and sell the best items in the world. Unfortunately, our items are constantly degrading in quality as they approach their sell by date. We bought a computer system that updates our inventory for us. Unfortunately, the system was developed many years ago and it needs to be updated. 

# System specification
A short introduction to our selling system:
* All items have a SellIn attribute which denotes the number of days we have to sell the item
* All items have a Quality attribute which denotes how valuable the item is
* At the end of each day our system decreases both values for every item
